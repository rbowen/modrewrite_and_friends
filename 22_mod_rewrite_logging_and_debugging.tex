\section{Logging}
\label{rewritelogging}

Exactly how you turn on logging for mod\_rewrite will depend on what version of the Apache http server you are running. Logging got some updates in the 2.4 release of the server, and the rewrite log was one of the changes that happened at that time.

If you're not sure what version you're running, you can get the \verb~httpd~ binary to tell you with the \verb~-v~ flag:

\begin{verbatim}
httpd -v
\end{verbatim}
