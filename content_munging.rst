Content Munging
===============

While mod_rewrite modifies aspects of the HTTP request - most commonly
the REQUEST_URI, sometimes you want to modify the content which is
served to the client. There are several modules that do this, which can
be used in a variety of circumstances.

We're going to look at three of these modules, and then at Filters in
general.

mod_sed

mod_proxy_html
