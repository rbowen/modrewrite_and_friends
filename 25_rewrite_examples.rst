\chapter{Rewrite Examples}
\label{rewriteexamples}

This chapter presents a cookbook of common examples of how you'll use mod\_rewrite in the real world. Each example is presented as a problem statement, a solution, and then a discussion of the solution and possible alternatives.

This chapter is likely to evolve over time, and so you are encouraged to check back at \verb~http://rewrite.rcbowen.com/~ frequently for updates.
