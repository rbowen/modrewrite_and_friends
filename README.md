mod_rewrite And Friends
=======================

Book: The definitive guide to mod_rewrite, URL manipulation, and content munging with the Apache http server

I started writing this in LaTeX, but those .tex files will go away soon, as I convert them to rst. See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html for more about reStructuredText.

'make latexpdf' to build PDF version. Various other make targets build
other formats. You'll need to have various TeX things installed, like
texlive, texlive-collection-extras, texlive-chextras, texlive-bold-extra
and texlive-collection-latexextra.

I'll document all the dependencies as soon as I figure them out. Let me
know if stuff doesn't build.
