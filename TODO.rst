TODO List and revision history
------------------------------

This book is a work in progress, and I expect it to remain such for years to come. This is the place to check to see if you've purchased the latest version, and what changed from one version to another.

While the version number starts with 0.something, you can expect that there's quite a bit of work yet to do. Once it is 1.something, you can expect that changes will be fairly minor. I think. We'll see.

REVISION HISTORY
````````````````


* 0.00 Started March 7, 2013. Started TOC and a little of the initial text. Published HTML version to website at http://rewrite.rcbowen.com/
* 0.01 March 12, 2013. Initial publish to Amazon.com in Kindle form.
* 0.02 March 18, 2013. Munged the TOC around a bit to make the chapters less crowded. Will end up with some sparse chapters initially. So what.
* 0.03 March 18, 2013. Added a bunch about flags. Completed reorg of TOC. I hope.
* ...
* 0.12 April 16, 2013. Started RewriteMap stuff, and various other tweaks and fixes.
* 0.15 August 10, 2013. Attended Flock. Decided to convert all LaTeX to rST instead. Many benefits, but quite a bit of work. Should have a rebuild in the next few days.
* 0.20 August 12, 2013. Completed conversion from LaTeX to rST. I'm sure there's still some orts here and there, but it's good enough to tag.
