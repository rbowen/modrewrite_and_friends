\chapter{TODO List and revision history}

This book is a work in progress, and I expect it to remain such for years to come. This is the place to check to see if you've purchased the latest version, and what changed from one version to another.

While the version number starts with 0.something, you can expect that there's quite a bit of work yet to do. Once it is 1.something, you can expect that changes will be fairly minor. I think. We'll see.
